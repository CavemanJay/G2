# G2
## Gommand and Gontrol
Golang Command and Control

Teamserver I think is done. 
- make sure that it doesn't crash if we use same name or port for service

Agent logic is done, just needs some commands so that its not useless.
- Need a few more commands
- ok this is cringe i gotta code sumn
- 


Front end for operator needs to be made as well, probably with react js or maybe just bootstrap.

G2 is a project made for educational purposes. I are not responsible for usage.
